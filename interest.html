    <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>My siblings and I like to stay active by playing sports. I love
            shooting hoops with my brothers, and playing other sports with 
            friends. When it comes to watching NBA,
            I am a huge San Antonio Spurs fan because of the humble 
            organization orchestrated by the legendary Coach Pop.
        </p>
    <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>I love trying different types of culture food. I can confidently
            cook the best homemade Korean beef, and cajun shrimp. Over the years
            I have crafted my cooking skills.
            It is true when they say practice makes improvement. 
            Before, my cooking used to be a hit-or-miss, but now, I don't have
        to worry about locating the nearest restroom, just in case. 
    <h2>Gym</h2>
            <p>I still prefer playing sports over gym; however, it is essential for me to
                work out for my mental and physical health. I am building a stronger fundamental 
                skills and patience to make sure I have a proper form in order to prevent injury.
                Recently, I have been incorporating boxing in my workout routine and it has been
                challenging, but rewarding. I learned that incorporating other activites and learning
                a new hobby at the same time really pushes me out of my comfort zone.
